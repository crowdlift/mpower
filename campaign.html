<h2 style="color:#39b54a;">Our <span style="color:#f37224;">BUY 1 — DONATE 1</span> Model</h2>
<p>Why “Buy 1—Donate 1”?<br>
Because in developing countries, <b>one billion people still depend on kerosene for light. </b>And the burning of kerosene lamps leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The equivalent of smoking 4 packs of cigarettes a day</li>
<li>Respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and lung cancer</li>
<li>The premature death of 1.5 million people every year</li>
<li>Trapping a family in poverty—about 20% of their income goes into buying kerosene</li>
<li>Global warming—kerosene burnt in Africa releases more CO2 than all CO2 released in the UK</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1460726481/buy-1-donate-1_fb6zgs.png" style="max-width:620px;"></p>

<p>Within our Perks (see right column) you'll find that <b>when you buy one M12 or one M24 Solar Generator, we'll donate in your name one M6 Solar Generator</b> plus an LED light to one family without electricity. Enough for this family to charge their cellphones, have harmless light at night and stop using their kerosene lamp. The M6 and the LED light save them time and miles of walking, and give them a better quality of life so they can read and study to escape poverty.<br>This may feel like a drop in the ocean, helping a handful of people out of the billion without electricity, but your contribution will be LIFE-CHANGING for the one family that receives an mPower Solar Generator because of your purchase.</p>

<p><b><span style="color:#f37224;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span> You do not pay more because of the donations.</b></p>
<p>Why? Because instead of spending money on advertising, we redirect this money and part of our profits, towards the donations.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Access to electricity is essential to a family’s health, safety, education, economic progress and quality of life.</p>

<p>Imagine what your life would be without electricity. Say goodbye to your cellphone, laptop, internet, TV, radio, music, refrigerator, air conditioning, lights at night, most medical exams, treatments, surgeries and much more.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:28px;line-height:1.25em;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;">Well, <b>one billion people</b> don’t need to imagine life <b>without electricity</b>, they experience it <b>every day of their lives</b>.</p>

<p>Read how these people manage their lives without electricity.</p>

<p><b>** We are constantly adding more FAQs into this section, if your
question is NOT covered here please send as an inquiry and we'll get back to
you as soon as we can**</b></p>

<p><b>How do I share this campaign to get Referrals for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br>Just make sure you are signed in to Indiegogo and use the social sharing menu on the left of this page (see below) to send a personalized link to your friends and family.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1461695436/Sharing_Tutorial_gjy7vt.png" style="max-width:620px;"></p>
<p><br></p>

<p><b>Who can participate in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br><u>Anyone from around the world</u> that is 18 years old or older, by Apr-11-2016. General requirements are: passion for volunteerism and for helping families in need, enthusiasm about the outdoors and overcoming challenges, ability to engage with others and successfully lead teams, willingness to visit places with precarious accommodations and good written and verbal English skills
</p>

<p><b>Does it matter for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge the amount contributed by the 'Referrals' I attract to the campaign?</b>
<br>No. The only thing that matters for the #LightUptheWorld Challenge is how many 'Referrals' actually visit the campaign. They do NOT need to contribute to add 'Referrals' points to your performance in the challenge.</p>

<p><b>Can I check how many 'Referrals' I’ve attracted so far within the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br>Of course. You can check as often as you want to. Please refer to the following instructions to do so: <a target="_blank" href="https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683" rel="noopener">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660683</a></p>

<p><b>How do I know if I am within the 12 finalists in the #LightUptheWorld Challenge?</b>
<br>Starting May-10 we will send a weekly email informing their performance to the participants ranked within the Top 12 in the challenge (and also to those that are close to reach the Top 12). To make sure you will be receiving these emails please send us an email to community@mpowersolargenerator.com with the subject '#LightUptheWord Challenge' and your Indiegogo user name.</p>

<p><b>Are there other compensation components beyond the US$ 150,000 annual salary?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Additionally to the salary, the company will provide the mPower Ambassador with 12 round trip airfares from Applicant’s home nearest capital city, all travel expenses paid during the year of the assignment while delivering the donated solar generators and travel insurance for the same period.
</p>

<p><b>Does the Buy 1-Donate 1 business model impact the retail prices of the mPower Solar Generators?</b>
<br>No. For-profit companies spend lots of money in advertising.&nbsp; We use the advertising money (plus, a portion of our profits) for donations instead of doing
advertising. We are confident that lots of caring people also want to help create a better world and one way of helping is by spreading the word about causes and products they care about.&nbsp; In this way, the portion of the sale that
usually gets reinvested in advertising, we can instead use it for donations resulting in a win/win/win for our customers, the company and the recipient of
the donation.</p>

<p><b>Where will you send the donated mPower Solar Generators?</b>
<br>The units donated as a result of the current Indiegogo campaign will be delivered by the mPower Ambassador jointly with TECHO's team to families without access to electricity in Haiti.  After this campaign we will evaluate and design a distribution program to bring much needed mPower Solar Generators to other countries.</p>

<p><b>What is TECHO?</b>
<br>TECHO.org (which means roof, in Spanish) is a youth led organization present in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean that seeks to overcome poverty in slums through engaging the joint work of volunteers and families living in extreme poverty. Over the last 19 years, through the work and donations of more than 750,000 caring volunteers and donors, TECHO has built over 100,000 transitional homes in 19 Latin-American countries for the poorest of the poor. Upon completion, TECHO implements social inclusion programs to show these people how to escape poverty for good.</p>

<p><b>Are mPower Solar Generators available in stores?</b>
<br>Currently, mPower products are available exclusively on Indiegogo.</p>

<p><b>Where is the mPower Solar Generator manufactured?</b>
<br>We invented the mPower Solar Generator in Florida, USA, the&nbsp;<b>Sunshine State</b>, where we will continue to design, develop and ultimately assemble the product with the very best components sourced from around the world.</p>

<p><b>What are the characteristics of the main components of the
mPower Solar Generator?</b>
<br>The mPower M12 and M24 include: crystalline silicon flexible solar panels, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries with an embedded battery management system (BMS) that includes overcharge and over discharge protection, pure sine wave inverters, and thermal circuit breakers.</p>

<p><b>Do I need any additional cables or components in order to use
the mPower Solar Generator?</b>
<br>No. The mPower Solar Generator has been designed to be ready to
use by any adult without the need of additional cables or components.</p>

<p><b>Can anyone use the mPower Solar Generator?</b>
<br>The mPower Solar Generator generates and store electric power similar to that of the electric grid at home. Minors should never use the mPower Solar Generator without adult supervision.</p>

<p><b>Can I connect additional solar panels to the mPower Solar Generator?</b>
<br>Yes, the mPower M12 and M24 accept additional solar panels to be connected to them. You will need special cables available from mPower that are not included with the product since they are not part of its core functionality.</p>

<p><b>Can I get more power by connecting two mPower Solar Generators together?</b>
<br>Yes, you can connect (daisy-chain) two mPower Solar Generators with special cables available from mPower.</p>

<p><b>What warranty do you offer on the mPower Solar Generator?</b>
<br>All mPower Solar Generators have a 1 year warranty including all of the components, even the battery.  The above warranty covers only defects arising under normal use and does not include malfunctions or failures resulting from misuse, abuse, neglect, alteration, problems with electrical power, usage not in accordance with product instructions, acts of nature, or improper installation or repairs made by anyone other than mPower or mPower’s authorized third-party service provider.</p>

<p><b>Where do you ship?</b>
<br>We ship worldwide! We make sure we ship the mPower Solar Generator according to safety transportation requirements.</p>

<p><b>Do you have a prototype ready?</b>
<br>Yes! We’ve built a fully-functional prototype following precise UL Certification guidelines and then produced a 3D printed case to fine-tune the design and test the connecting parts.</p>
